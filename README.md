# ATMS-523-Module-8-project-smhenry2
Module 8 project for ATMS523 - Logistic Regression for Identifying Developing and Non-developing TCs

This module will evaluate the performace of a logistic regression model in identifying whether a tropical disturbance will develop or not.

The dataset is based off ERA5 vorticity and moisture tracking to identify TC "seeds," both developing and non-developing. The developing seeds are matched to IBTrACS to truncate the distrbance before TC genesis.
